		<h1> About me </h1>
		<p>I'm Sarah, I'm a junior at Elon, planning to major in <b>Com Design</b> and minor in <b>Computer Science</b>. I'm from Richmond, Vriginia.  My favorite holiday is halloween. I play in the marching band, I work in Res Life, and I love my pets.</p>

		<h3>My pets...</h3>
		<p>My dog is named <i>Millie</i>.  She's an old girl but she still loves to play.  She is a big lab/mastiff mix with brown stripey fur and a white belly.  She is the friendliest dog I have ever known and she loves to sleep.  <br> My cat's name is <i>Mushroom</i>.  My friend, Elizabeth, and I found him in a bush outside the Mellow Mushroom which is where his name comes from.  He's about 7 months old now and very handsome. </p>
